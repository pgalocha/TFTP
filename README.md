# TFTP

TFTP is a small and very safe mini ftp server. You can read more about it [here].

This is the repo for my implementation of a TFTP server and it's respective client for the Operating Systems class that I'm attending.

## Changelog
- Server
    - Launches a child process for each file request, a thread for each file request or a pool of threads, depending on your OperationMode flag (2 for pool, 1 for threads, 0 for forks)
- Client
    - Remote ls (list) all files in given dir
    - Remote mget (multiple get) - retrieves every file in the given dir, launching a child process or a thread for each file request, depending on your OperationMode flag (1 for threads, 0 for forks)
    - Elapsed time in microseconds

## Initial functionalities
- Server
    - Bind to a port in the host computer
    - Serve one file at a time
- Client
    - GET [fileName] - Retrieve the file from the server
    - PUT [fileName] - Put the file in the server
